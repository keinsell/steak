In my work as a software developer, I have used a variety of tools to build and deploy software. My toolset has evolved over time as new technologies have emerged and as my skills and experience have grown. By tracking the changes in my toolset over time, I can gain insights into how technology is evolving and how my own skills and preferences are changing.

## Programming Languages

- `[2021]` **[Rust]()**: Rust is a promising language in my stack. I have used it to write Solana smart contracts, and it is now one of my main focuses to build serverless and standalone servers with Rust because of its higher stability than TypeScript itself.
- `[2018]` **[TypeScript]()**: TypeScript is one of my favourite and most widely used programming languages for building web servers and front-end applications.
- `[2015]` **[JavaScript]()**: Ideal language for starting programming as itâ€™s language for people with negative IQ.
- `[2013]` **[Java]()**: Trying to write and build my own Minecraft servers when I was teenager, do mind using this piece of shit again.
  
## Message Queue

- `[2021]` **[Redpanda]()**: Redpanda is a streaming platform that is built on top of Apache Kafka. It provides a range of features such as stream processing, message persistence, and in-memory caching.
- `[2020]` **[NATS]()**: NATS is a cloud-native messaging system that is designed to be highly performant and scalable. It supports a range of messaging patterns and is widely used in cloud-native applications.
- `[2018]` **[RabbitMQ]()**: RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker that is widely used for message-oriented middleware. It provides a range of features such as message routing, clustering, and high availability.
- `[2018]` **[Apache Kafka]()**: Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is designed to be highly scalable and fault-tolerant. It provides a range of features such as message persistence, replication, and stream processing.

## Database

- `[2022]`  **[YugabyteDB]()**: Experimenting Right Now
- `[2018]`  **[CockroachDB]()**: Fancy PostgresSQL
- `[2015]` **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that is designed to be highly scalable and flexible. It provides a range of features such as dynamic schema, horizontal scaling, and indexing. It is commonly used in web applications, content management systems, and other applications that require flexible data modeling.
- `[2013]` **MySQL**: MySQL is an open-source relational database that is widely used in many applications. It provides a range of features such as transactions, indexing, and replication. It is a reliable choice for traditional relational databases and can be used in various applications.
