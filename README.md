Introduction to my choice of tools around the world.

## Programming Languages

- `[2018]` **[TypeScript]()**: TypeScript is one of my favourite and most widely used programming languages for building web servers and front-end applications.
- `[2021]` **[Rust]()**: Rust is a promising language in my stack. I have used it to write Solana and Cosmos smart contracts, and it is now one of my main focuses to build serverless and standalone servers with Rust because of its higher stability than TypeScript itself.
  
## Message Queue

- `[2021]` **[Redpanda]()**: Redpanda is a streaming platform that is built on top of Apache Kafka. It provides a range of features such as stream processing, message persistence, and in-memory caching.
- `[2020]` **[NATS]()**: NATS is a cloud-native messaging system that is designed to be highly performant and scalable. It supports a range of messaging patterns and is widely used in cloud-native applications.
